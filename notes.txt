things to look for

version:
tempo:
tracks with each track containing:
	id
	name
	16 steps


patterns I notice
version:
	-starts at hex offset 0xe (index 14) (this value is included), ends at the first 00 hex value 
	-encode the following bytes into ascii to get the version (ex. "0.808-alpha")


tempo:
	-the tempo is encoded as 32 bit floating point number with little endian byte order 
		-8 hexadecimal digits (4 bytes, each represented by 2 hexadecimal digits), since each digit is 4 bits
		-starting at hex offset 0x2e (index 46), ending at index 50

tracks:
	overall, starts at hex offset 0x32 (index 50) (this value is included) -> convert this to decimal to get the first track's ID

	for each track:
		ID: encode the byte at index 0 (for the given track), to get the ID
		name: starts at index 5 (for the given track). starting here, convert the next hex values to ascii for the track name. STOP when you reach a hex value of 00 or 01 (this is where the 16 steps begin)
		16 steps: starts at the first hex value after the name that is 00 or 01. 01 represents a triggered step, 00 reprents an empty step. This will continue for 16 bytes, after which the next track's information begins.
